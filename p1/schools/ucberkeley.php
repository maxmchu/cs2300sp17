                    <b>Common and Prominent Memes</b><br/>

                    EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science<br/>
                    <i>EECS students are often described in memes as having poor social skills, hygeine, and being Berkeley's smartest students.</i><br/><br/>
                    
                    Pre-Haas are Snakes<br/>
                    <i>Pre-Haas students, Berkeley's pre-business students, are often described as back-stabbing snakes only interested in internships on Wall Street.</i><br/><br/>
                    
                    Dirks and Public Funds <br/>
                    <i>Memes involving UC Berkeley's chancellor, Nicholas Dirks, often center around a controversy involving the alleged misuse of public funds, prompting his resignation.</i><br/><br/>
                    
                    As a member of the Greek community...<br/>

                    <i>Following the posting of a meme comparing sororities at UC Berkeley to Mean Girls, one sorority member posted a salty comment, immortalized in dozens of mocking memes that followed.</i><br>
                    As a member of the Greek community and part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. Sororities at UC Berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values that they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.
